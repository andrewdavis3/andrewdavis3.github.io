# Another tool for the Bioinformatics tool belt

Multipass - a mini-cloud on your workstation(https://multipass.run/) 
As tools like docker have helped with packaging tools into a operating system enviroment
where all the installed tools are working in symbosis. Sometime it nice to have ubuntu already 
fire up to test out new tool. This is where multipass may come in handy. For my mac, I already 
had Virtualbox install,I then installed multipass via brew `brew cask install multipass`. I then
had to run ` sudo multipass set local.driver=virtualbox` to get multipass to start up.
